esp32_sound_and_light
=====================

This is a project-in-progress using LEDs and sound sensors to do interesting things with the ESP32 system on a chip by Espressif.

This project is built using the ESP-IDF and cmake.

Modules will eventually be place in an *examples* folder and need to be copied into the root folder to run. Until then, modules in progress will reside in the *main* folder within the root folder.

*components* folder not implemented yet. Hopefully coming soon as the project evolves.
